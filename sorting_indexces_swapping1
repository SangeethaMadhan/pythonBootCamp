# Program to sort an array using index swapping method - in decending order - minimum to maximum value.
# Which don't require temporary variable to store the sorted output.
# Find the minimum value in the array and swap its index with 0th index - min(arr) to 0th index
# The value present at 0th index will be in the index position at the position where minimum value was there.
# Likewise the 1th index value compared with all the other index value and 2nd least value swapped with 1st index value.
# This looping continue till the last element in array.
