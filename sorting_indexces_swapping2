# Program to sort an array using swapping indexces
# First find the minimum value in the list and replace (swap) it with the 0th index value.
# Likewise for next least value in the list to be found and swapped in the 1st index position and its value
# Repeating the swapping until all the values in the list sorted in ascending order.

# Pseudocode: Set an array to be sorted.
# For swapping have 2 index i and j, where i is the first index so set value as 0
# Index j will be the next to i index so j = i+1
# Both index value compared in a loop of incrementing next index and if any smaller value found it is swapped to respective order


list = [12,5,9,2,18,6]
i = 0
last = len(list)-1 # length of the list will be the value of last 

while i<=last:
    least = i
    j = i+1 # updating to next index

    while j<=last:
        if list[least]>list[j]: # if next index has higher value assign j with mimimum value
            least = j
        j = j+1 # updating to next index

    list[i], list[least] = list[least], list[i] # if least value found, replacing with idex
    print(list[i], list[least])
    i = i+1 # updating to next index


print("Sorted list: ", list)
